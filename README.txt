Hi¡ we´re ProMaterial+ team
we developed a GUI ”easy materials”

Are you a materials scientist? (metallurgical, chemist ,... engineer); but you can't use the computational tools easily?  (DFT provided from NASA, PyCalphad...etc)
NOW¡ you can access these from our interface.  *se muestra la aplicación* 

You can select materials getting viability from design alloys or even simulate the movement of particles as a function of temperature. 

You will be able to use more modules (mostramos los módulos imagen de Montecarlo, atomman) to improve your researchers


First APPLICATION
AtomMan
Atomman, after defining a temperature and a number of particles, a graph is shown that simulates the behavior of these



SECOND APPLICATION
Hume Rothery
This program aims to apply the Hume-Rothery rules for two substances to validate whether they can form a binary isomorphic alloy.

This program aims to apply the Hume-Rothery rules for two substances to validate whether they can form a binary isomorphic alloy.

https://github.com/fedebarco/nassaBackend 
This is a web backend that would have the function of displaying an API in which the phase diagrams of an alloy can be observed as a function of its temperature and pressure.
